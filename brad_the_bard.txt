# Doss Lute
**Wondrous item, uncommon, requires attunement**

The Doss Lute is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary lute in every way. It is made of three kinds of wood, expertly blended together, in a textured pattern depicting a variety of forest animals.

A creature that attempts to play the Doss Lute without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage. After attuning to the Doss Lute, it may be used by a Bard as a spellcasting focus.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

When you use the instrument to cast a spell that causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect applies whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.

**Spells:**
• Animal Friendship
• Fly
• Invisibility
• Levitate
• Protection from Energy (fire only)
• Protection from Evil and Good
• Protection from Poison

We met a new Teifling named Anne,
Who came to an evil cursed land.
We saved you from frozen,
But killed your pal Leoben,
Honestly this is going better than planned.

I know of a barbarian named Kote,
Who outwits neither goldfish nor goat,
Nothing stands in his path,
Except maybe math,
At least when he swims he'll float

Here stands the mighty Illican!
Who could grapple even a minivan,
When we call on our hero,
Your movement speed is zero,
Or perhaps he'll throw a patch of catamaran.

There goes Hugo the halfling,
Who's plans are always unravelling.
You'd think that a monk,
Wouldn't be stoned nor drunk.
At least it makes for adventurous travelling.

Fuck this stupid asshole Strahd,
His character is well beyond flawed.
Lame sad boi in a cloak,
Barovia is a joke.
He can't even hold down a broad.

Go die you ugly ass witch,
Just looking at you is making me itch.
You're a useless lackey,
Strahd's plaything chachki,
I wouldn't honour you by calling you a bitch.
